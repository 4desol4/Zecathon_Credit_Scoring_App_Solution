# Alternative Credit Scoring System – Zecathon 5.0 (Track 2)

## Overview
This project is an alternative credit scoring system designed to evaluate users and MSMEs using non-traditional financial data instead of relying on credit bureau history. It analyzes transaction patterns, cash flow, stability, and financial behavior to generate a FICO-style score ranging from **300 to 850**. The system also provides risk classification and personalized financial recommendations.

An AI/ML credit scoring model will be added later for predictive scoring and automated credit decisioning.
